{"name":"Sag PHP CRUD Tutorial","tagline":"My humble attempt","body":"### Hi there!\r\nI'm not claiming to be an expert at cloudant. I started literally a month ago, so for all I know this is the most inefficient code that ever efficient-ed. But seeing as how documentation for this is scarce, heres my half-butt attempt at creating a basic tutorial on doing simple CRUD functions in Cloudant, using PHP and the Sag API. I thought after spending the amount of time I did to learn it that I'd help some more beginner-y people out! \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nI'll try to help, but don't count on it. Email me at [me@gwendolyn.info]!\r\n","google":"UA-65908031-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
